# Tip Request

#### _Coming soon to the App Store!_

_Tip Request_ was created as a way to allow users to track food purchases they have made, all with a built-in tip calculator. Quick Tip is where you can calculate tips on the go, open Apple's _Wallet_ in-app, or subsequently add them to your history of past transactions. More importantly, your history is saved to your device locally, where you can view and edit locations, totals, and tips.

#### Future Additions

* Google sign-in
* Google Firebase integration to track purchases across devices
* Sync and use same database as Tip Request for Android
